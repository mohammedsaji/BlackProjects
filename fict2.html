When a massive whale unexpectedly gets trapped in a hidden sea cave, it sets off a chain of events that will change the lives of the villagers forever.

                As Ava delves deeper into the secrets of the cave and the history of the village, she uncovers long-buried truths about the whale, the community, and even herself. Along the way, she forms unlikely alliances and confronts personal challenges, all while racing against time to save the magnificent creature before it's too late.</p></div>
