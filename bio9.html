            <div class="prod_desc"><p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. He was a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule and is widely regarded as the father of the Indian nation.

                Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance, known as Satyagraha, played a central role in India's struggle for independence. He advocated for peaceful protests, civil disobedience, and passive resistance as effective means of achieving social and political change. Through his leadership, Gandhi inspired millions of Indians to join the freedom struggle and galvanized support for independence from British colonial rule.</p></div>
